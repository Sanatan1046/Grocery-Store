  <div class="centered"><p>The grocery business is changing and it’s changing fast. You can call it a revolution, another victim in the retail apocalypse, the latest sector to be disrupted by tech or yet another industry being “killed” by millennials. One thing is for certain: a grocery revolution began in earnest in 2017, and it’s far from over. An industry that was the stable, boring bedrock of the consumer market for decades came under pressure from all directions this past year. The moats which had protected this reliable business were drained by new technologies, growing consumer revolt from our current unsustainable food system, and a looming logistics revolution on the horizon.</p>
  <p>While consumers have quickly shifted to online channels to buy goods like clothing or technology items, they are still reluctant to turn to eCommerce to purchase certain goods, like fresh or frozen foods.</p>
  <p>Change is part of every industry. The grocery industry is no different. Evolution has become necessary, mostly driven by customer preferences. The grocery shopping experience is evolving with the support of technology.

The grocery business is competitive, so retailers have to evolve, and part of that is automation. Automation is essential to grocery store’s future. Automation isn’t a bad thing. Tasks that don’t require a human mind and can be processed more efficiently this way.

The grocery shopping experience involves automation and technology like it never has before. While younger generations and digital natives have been quick to adopt the convenience of ordering groceries online and picking them up or having them delivered; it’s also helped older generations. Baby boomers are embracing it as well, and they benefit greatly from it since they may not be able to shop themselves.

Ultimately, grocery fulfillment is mostly about saving time, which is a precious commodity. Most households are very busy with working parents and active kids. Who has time to shop? The amount of time a family can save through grocery fulfillment is a real game-changer, and just shows how the customer is driving this revolution.

In addition to retailers adapting, there are also new industries infiltrating the market that are helping deliver a better solution with technology such as robotics. Grocery stores have to adapt when it comes to grocery fulfillment, and they need partners. Walmart and Amazon are leading the way. This change is good. It’s good for the end-user and the retailers.</p>
